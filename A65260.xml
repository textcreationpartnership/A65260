            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:103185:2"/>
            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THough by the Providence of him <hi>by whom Kings reign,</hi> the moſt Ancient and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer'd Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath continued by Succeſſion (maugre all Oppoſition) in the Heirs of the Royal <hi>Fergus,</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> whoſe Inauguration was about 330 Years before the Incarnation of the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus:</hi> Yet ſome Tranſlations there have
<pb facs="tcp:103185:3"/>been, for want of Heirs Male; and by inter-marriages ſome later Families of their Ancient and War-like Nobility have been graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into that Royal Stock, and have thereby grown up to bear that Virgin Crown.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ST<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ARTS</hi> were the laſt that were Honour'd in this kind, of whom there have not been many Kings, yet all of them ſo Good, ſo Vertuous and Wiſe, that no Hiſtory whether Sacred or Civil, can paralel the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>The Various Diſpenſations of
<pb facs="tcp:103185:3"/>God towards them (eſpecially in their Dangers and Deliverances,) may in a great meaſure be ſeen in this enſuing Mirrour.</p>
            <p>As for the Occurrences in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Affairs, ſince the day of our happy Union of Crowns; in <hi>James</hi> the Sixth of undying Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, though it be true, we may in them be furniſh'd with more Inſtances of ſignal Preſervations than from former Ages; and tho' God in our late miraculous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, as alſo in thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Qualifications conferr'd upon our Kings, adequate to the weight of a Prince's Crown, hath
<pb facs="tcp:103185:4"/>evidenc'd a ſpecial regard to, and approbation of Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Yet in regard our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtories do abound with the Remarks and Memoirs of thoſe times to ſupply the Defects of our Memories, it would appear an over-acted Deſign to lanch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into other Mens Labours, than what I have here offer'd to View, and would rather ſeem to Encumber than Accommodate the Age we live in.</p>
            <p>If it ſhall appear ſtrange to any that theſe Poſthumous Sheets, She-Orphan-like be expos'd in the World without the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:103185:4"/>or Protection of ſome Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Patron. It is not for want of Perſons that would willingly and could truly have Dignified the Endeavours of our Deceaſed Authour by ſuffering their Names to be prefixed hereto; but becauſe the Deſign having relation only to the Anceſtors of our King, I feared an alienation of its Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation might look injuriouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Royalty of his Sacred Majeſty, to whom alone, with his moſt Illuſtrious Brother, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Right of Patronage doth belong: But ſo little is my eſteem of my Self, and ſo great my Veneration for Royal Majeſty,
<pb facs="tcp:103185:5"/>that I dare not think my ſelf worthy to offer any thing, (tho' the beſt I have) at his Feet: Which Conſideration alone hath diverted me from the thoughts of a Dedication.</p>
            <p>Yet I hope, in recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Work, I may tell the World that the Author was a Native of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo may be thought no Stranger to the Hiſtory of his own Countrey: His early Merits advanced him at the Age of Twenty Three, to be Preacher at the <hi>Cannigate</hi> in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> about the Year 1636. that by no worſe intereſt than
<pb facs="tcp:103185:5"/>that of the Learned <hi>Spotſwood:</hi> Here he continued not long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Covenant (ſo Fatal to all Loyal and Religious Men) forc'd him for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Life and Loyalty, to retire from that Honourable and Advantageous Imployment, to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> whither the Storm purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo Embroiling the Affairs of that Bleſſed Prince, <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, (whoſe Memory is too great and too good to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt with the common Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Age) that they ſoon reduc'd him from his Princely Eſtate, wherein he was always
<pb facs="tcp:103185:6"/>ready and willing to afford Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to his Friends, to ſo Low a fortune, that he, the beſt of Kings, could in his Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms find no place of Safety or Defence for himſelf.</p>
            <p>All that our Author could then acquire, was a preſentation to a ſmall Vicarage in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> as I ſuppoſe, in the King's hands, Sir <hi>Thomas Corbet,</hi> a Young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of an Ancient and Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Family the Patron of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then a Minor and his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Ward.</p>
            <p>Here he lived in Repute with
<pb facs="tcp:103185:6"/>all good Men for his Eminency in Learning, Loyalty, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, until the exrraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and affections of the honeſt and loyal Gentry provok'd the malice of the Rebellious Committee againſt him, and that place could afford him no longer ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Then by the favourable Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Bendiſh,</hi> one of his Majeſty's Deputy Lieutenants, and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Norwich,</hi> a great lover of Loyalty, Religion, and Learning; (to whom greater Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are due,) he was remov'd to <hi>Kirkby Cane,</hi> a Rectory in the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:103185:7"/>County, in the Gift of <hi>Richard Cateline</hi> Eſq; a Gentleman whoſe Sufferings were too ſevere Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials of his Fidelity to his Prince, and his whole Life a Contexture of great Prudence, Piety, and Charity: Amongſt the many bleſſings that attended his Life, it was not his leaſt happineſs that he was the Father of the preſent Sir <hi>Nevil Cateline,</hi> who was his Eldeſt Son that ſurviv'd the Calamity of the Civil War; a Gentleman he is whoſe Vertues are ſufficient Indications of his Birth, he Inheriting not only the outward fortune, but alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Noble and Generous Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
<pb facs="tcp:103185:7"/>of his Parents Minds; and though he may ſeem to have ſtept before ſome of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in Titles of Eminency, yet none that rightly knows him, can think his Titles keep equal pace with his Merit.</p>
            <p>Here he ſpent a dozen Years and upwards in a Retir'd and Pious Solitude, (living in great Regard and Eſteem with his good Patron, and is not yet dead in the memory of his Son) until the happy Reſtauration of His Sacred MAJESTY, when True Religion and Loyalty might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask themſelves, and with their
<pb facs="tcp:103185:8"/>Primitive Confidence look into the World: Then having wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd out the Storm, at the firſt appearance of the Long-benighted Sun, he reſorted to <hi>London</hi> to Congratulate the Joyful Change in National Affairs; he had the Honour to kiſs His Majeſty's Hand, and receive ſome further aſſurances of his Bounty; but returning in a Pleonaſm of Joy, he expir'd in the Extaſie without any more marks of Royal Favour upon him.</p>
            <p>He left theſe looſe and unpoliſh'd Papers behind him, doubtleſs deſign'd, tho' not perfected, to be offer'd to His Majeſty, as a Congratulation
<pb facs="tcp:103185:8"/>of his Return to his Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms: But that opportunity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, I have ſince thought them no better than Uſeleſs Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, until lately peruſing of them, and Reflecting upon the Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm of ſome Polititians, and the Incredulity of all diſaffected and diſcontented Minds, not to be convinc'd of Day-light by the brighteſt Beams that ever darted from the Sun; I was induc'd to believe that the Idiome and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberance of the matter and Phraſe being a little corrected, an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome might be extracted not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delightful nor unuſeful for the
<pb facs="tcp:103185:9"/>preſent Age: Being an Age wherein great Attempts have been made againſt the Succeſſion ſo long uninterrupted; and the Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, though never ſo Sacred, have all been diſputed, by Men of ſo looſe and diſloyal Principles; that could they effect their Deſigns upon thoſe Supports to an Hereditary Crown; would not eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to give over attempting till they have Extirpated, not only the Royal Line, but Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Monarchy it ſelf; Nor can the moſt Chriſtian Charity think otherwiſe, when we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:103185:9"/>of thoſe very Men to be great Sticklers, and all of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion to be great Favourers of the Deſign; who thought they had once effectually done it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and now by the Terrors of a guilty Conſcience, are Stimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to repent the Wickedneſs, not thinking themſelves eaſie or ſafe under the protection of a Family which they have ſo Barbarouſly and ſo Inhumanly Affronted, tho' perhaps the greateſt inſtance of Royal Clemency and Mercy that Hiſtory affords: And certainly that ſingle act of Barbarity committed againſt the Sacred Perſon of our
<pb facs="tcp:103185:10"/>late Martyr'd Sovereign, were there nothing elſe in their whole practice, is enough to ſully the faireſt <hi>Fucus</hi> to confute their beſt Arguments for the ſupport of their pretended Zeal, and to render their very Principles Odious and Abominable to all reaſonable Men in future Ages.</p>
            <p>The Peruſal of theſe few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks or Hiſtorical Obſervations, (full of Loyalty and Impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) together with a Reflection, not only upon the Reſtauration of His Majeſty to the Honours and Dignities of His Three Crowns, but alſo upon thoſe Deliverances
<pb facs="tcp:103185:10"/>which bear a later Date and are freſh Inſtances of Mens Diſloyalty, of our King's great Wiſdom, and God's peculiar Providence over him: Theſe things (I ſay) taken into Serious Conſideration, may afford Men a Convincing proſpect of the Folly as well as the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of all Attempts againſt a Throne of Divine Eſtabliſhment, and that atteſted by ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Deliverances and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations: All that the People do is but to imagine a vain Thing. That God who hath ſet the Crown upon his Head will enable him to break all their Bonds aſunder, and to
<pb facs="tcp:103185:11"/>caſt away their Cords from him: <hi>Yea, he that dwelleth in Heaven ſhall laugh them to ſcorn, the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion.</hi>

Before his Execution the Law of Retaliation is by the King's ſpecial Command executed upon him. A poor Widdow pillaged by him, threateneth him with reſolution to repair to the King for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; and I will fit thee for thy Journey, ſaid the Rogue; he calleth for a Black-Smith, and commands him to Nail to her Feet two Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Shooes; go on ſaith he, now theſe will preſerve thy Feet from bruiſing: the poor Woman diſſembleth her reſolution, and is diſmiſſed: Mr. <hi>Donald</hi> being afterwards apprehended, the Widdow repaireth to his Majeſty, reporteth and proveth this Inſolent Trick; Mr. <hi>Donald</hi> is called for out of Priſon, Horſe-ſhooes are clap'd on himſelf and twelve of his Companions, and commanded to march through the Streets of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> an Officer publiſhing the Cauſe of this ſtrange Puniſhment; their tedious Journey ended, all of them are put to Death, as before mentioned: King <hi>James</hi> hearing that <hi>Maloc</hi> was under the Power of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lord, ſendeth a Meſſenger to <hi>Ireland,</hi> to require the Lord to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him; the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lord fearing his Eſcape, and the Anger of ſo War-like a Prince, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to make all ſure by cutting off the Rebel's Head, which was accordingly done and ſent over to the King.

            <p>The Civil Eſtate thus happily regulated, his Majeſty thinketh of a Reformation of the Clergy, but to ſmall purpoſe; they being then and in thoſe days within the Verge of the <hi>Pope</hi> his Juriſdiction, Secular Princes durſt not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Regal Power over them; all this good King could do, was to plant the Schools and Univerſities, Seminaries of good Learning, with Pious and Learned men, to whom he gave ſo many Encouragements, that the fruits of ſo good a Project were ſoon ſeen and perceived by all, to the great Joy of all good Men, and the immortal Praiſe of ſo good a Prince.</p>
            <p>Neither did this good King reſt in the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the Liberal Sciences, but reſolving to advance all Mechanick Trades (wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed by the tediouſneſs, miſery of an 150 Years War) ſendeth over to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and from thence conduceth moſt exquiſite Artificers of all ſorts, to whom he gave great Rewards and large Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities; by which Princely Munificence, Trades of all ſorts thrive and flouriſh, the Poor ſet to Work, and many Enriched; every man acknowledging the happineſs of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

            <p>Soon after arrived Ambaſſadors from <hi>France</hi> to demand the young Lady formerly Eſpouſed to the <hi>Dauphine,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1432"/> to be ſent over for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the Marriage.</p>
            <p>Ambaſſadors likewiſe come at the ſame time from <hi>England,</hi> with full purpoſe at once to break not only this Matrimonial, but alſo that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient National League between the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> to which end they propound a League Offenſive and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, with a Tender of <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Roxbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> to be Reſtored forthwith; many other things likewiſe were Tendered, promiſing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fairly to the Good of both Kingdoms, if as fully performed as freely promiſed.

            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadors reſent this Denial, as a Diſhonour, and immediately denounce War againſt the <hi>Scots;</hi> threatning withal, by their Navy to Way-lay the Princeſs in her paſſage to <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Princeſs is ſent over forthwith under the guard of a very ſtately Navy, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy attempting nothing, her Highneſs ſafely Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveth, and her Marriage to the <hi>Dauphine,</hi> with

            <p>About the ſame time Earl <hi>Percy</hi> entreth into <hi>Scotland</hi> with 4000, rather to ſpoil than fight: <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> Earl of <hi>Anyus</hi> is ſent againſt him with the like number, <hi>Percy</hi> is overthrown, a few ſlain on either ſide; of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> 1500 taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> thus provoked by Way-laying the young Lady by Sea, and by this Inroad by Land; raiſeth a great Army, with purpoſe to Invade <hi>Northumberland:</hi> in this way he layeth Siege to <hi>Roxborrow,</hi> then in the hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> expecting in few days the Delivering of it into his hands.</p>
            <p>In the mean while cometh the Queen into his Camp diſcovering to him a moſt horrid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon intended by his own nigheſt Kindred, againſt both his Perſon and Poſterity.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty perceiving that her Relation proceeded not from Womaniſh fear, but from ſuch real Grounds as were not to be ſlighted, raiſeth his Siege, and without Advice of any, Disbandeth his Army, to the no leſs Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than Diſcontent of moſt about him; being Strangers to the cauſe of this ſudden and unexpected Change: His Majeſty poſteth to St. <hi>John</hi>'s Town (as a Bird into a Snare) of purpoſe to make a fuller Diſcovery, of that horrible Plot.</p>
            <p>The Treaſon being ripe, and ready for Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, the Traitors privately repair thither, with a ſmall hand of Conſpirators: The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103185:29"/>of that Traiterous Band, <hi>Athol</hi> and his Couſin <hi>Graham,</hi> knowing the Weakneſs of the King's Guard, enter privately into the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery where his Majeſty lay, and by Conduct of one of his Houſhold Servants, debauched into the Conſpiracy, they come to the Stairs which led to the Royal Chamber: The Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer at the ſame time coming down, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them in Arms, Crieth out with a loud Voice, Treaſon; him they forthwith Murder, and make haſt to the Door, made faſt by no ſtronger bar (the Iron Bolt being ſtolen away by the Traiterous Servant in Conſpiracy with them) than the Tender wreſt of a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, which quickly broke; the Aſſaſſinates furiouſly ruſh in, and run towards his Majeſty, which the Queen perceiving, caſteth her ſelf upon the King, endeavouring poor Lady to preſerve him, they drag her from him, not without ſome dangerous Wounds; and forgetting all fear of God and Man, thruſt their Swords above Forty times through the Heart and Body of the moſt Excellent Prince.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of this horrid Aſſaſſination, was that old Mother of much Miſchief, Ambition: <hi>Athold,</hi> the King's old Uncle, having already by his Helliſh Subtlety, brought ſome of his nigheſt Kinſmen, who lay in his way to the Crown, to untimely Ends, reſolveth at laſt to ſtrike at the main Rub, the King himſelf; for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing whereof he ſnatcheth the advantage of the Diſcontent of <hi>Robert Graham</hi> Tutor of <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herne,</hi> to whom he propoundeth his Deſign,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103185:30"/>craveth his Conjunction therein, with aſſurance not only of Protection but of ample Rewards, and great Preferments when he comes to his Kingdom. <hi>Graham</hi> graſpes at all, and joyneth in the Traiterous Deſign with him. To this Combination <hi>Athol</hi> calleth his own Grandchild, <hi>Robert,</hi> a Youth nimble both in Head and Hand, whom he likewiſe debaucheth into this Treaſonable Plot. The Treaſon thus Craftily contrived, is Cunningly carried on, and at laſt cruelly Executed, as before.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103185:34"/>lately mentioned, is extremely perplexed: In Council, after many Self-debates, he reſolveth at laſt, not daring to truſt himſelf to the Earl <hi>Dowglas,</hi> upon all hazards to haſt to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> with a ſmall Retinue, to try whether by ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo low, the Storm might paſs over him: to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> he repaireth, and by mediation of the Biſhops of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> Men Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Pious, and Prudent; a Perſonal Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is obtained with the Chancellor: The Vice-Roy with a ſad Countenance, deploreth their unhappy Diviſions, declaimeth againſt them as Dangerous to the Publick, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to their own private Intereſts: he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploreth an happy Union between them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they muſt both Periſh; promiſing on his part an Oblivion of all things paſt, and all fair Reſpect in time to come. The Chancellor well knowing that Deſtruction to both muſt needs be the Iſſue of the Diviſions between them, chearfully hearkneth to the propoſition of Peace, they preſently accord, and an Union is now the ſecond time concluded between them; and notwithſtanding Diſtreſs enough to the People, and Danger more than enough to the young King, flowing from their divided Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, theſe two cunning Catchers accord to continue ſtill in their reſpective.

            <p>The Earl moved by the publick Faith thus ingaged, and by the ſpecious Promiſes ſo So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly made, repaireth to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> without Fear or Jealouſie: The Chancellor meeteth him before he came within ten Miles of the City, and inviteth him to his Caſtle at <hi>Chrichton,</hi> where he Entertaineth him magnificently, in all his Diſcourſe ſo highly commending the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family of the <hi>Dowglaſſes,</hi> their worthy Acts and high Deſerts both of King and Country, and ſo fully declaring the great hopes himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the young Earl himſelf, that the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of <hi>Dowglas</hi> his Retainers began to ſuſpect ſome Miſchief to lurk under the covert of thoſe ſpecious Words, which they knew were no leſs unuſual in him, than unbeſeeming his Place and Authority.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103185:35"/>truſt his whole Family under the hazard of one Blow, that he would not carry along with him his dear and only Brother; but all in vain, his Deſtiny drives him no faſter than he is willing to run to his own Ruine; he entereth the City, and is by the Chancellor attended to the Caſtle, whither the Vice-Roy likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paireth, and entertaineth him with all Civility; yea, and to Honour him the more, he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the King's own Table, and feaſted with no ſmall Solemnity: But behold, amidſt all their Chear and great Mirth, a Band of Armed Men enters the Dining Chamber, and a Bull's Head is clap'd on the Table (a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Token, in thoſe days, of an appointed and approaching Death) the Earl is too late ſtricken with Fear, and endeavouring to riſe, the Armed Men lay hold on him,

            <p>This Overthrow enrageth the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> a new Army is appointed to be Levied: Civil Wars in <hi>England</hi> croſs all: An Ambaſſador is ſent to <hi>Scotland</hi> to deſire Peace, Peace could not be obtained: A Ceſſation of Arms only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and that with much ado, for three Years.

            <p>His Majeſty is in a ſtrait, the Petitions being ſuch, as could not in Juſtice be refuſed; and the Earl not being preſent, could not in Juſtice be Condemned: in the mean time the Earl his Proctor is called, for to get in what Anſwer he could; who refuſing to appear, is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Priſon: Many counſel harder things againſt him, as guilty of high Contempt of Royal Majeſty: the King inclining to Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, calleth for him out of Reſtraint, and Commandeth him to Plead for his Lord freely and without Fear, which the Proctor, thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, accordingly performed: His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty having patiently heard all that poſſibly could be ſaid, adjudgeth reaſonable Satisfaction to be made to the Oppreſſed: The Proctor craveth reſpite till the return of his Lord; The King adjudgeth preſent Satisfaction; and to that end Lord <hi>William Sinclare</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney,</hi> and at that time Lord Chancellor, is ſent into <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Dowglaſdale,</hi> to Commiſſionate Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors to Levy my Lord's Retinue for Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Sums adjudged; the Collectors all ſlighted, and continued, return home, having done juſt nothing.</p>

               <hi>James</hi> much moved at this laſt Paſſage, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Meſſengers what Inſtructions they had from their Lords concerning the Promiſe of Surrendering into his hands all his Towns, Forts and Caſtles, in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> power; they acknowledge none: The King bids them tell their Lords, <hi>That not their Words, but their Swords, muſt raiſe him from the Siege.</hi> The Siege conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth, and is reinforced by additional Forces under Earl <hi>Hantkey</hi> and <hi>Donald</hi> Lord of the <hi>Iſles,</hi> who to ingratiate himſelf the more to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, tendereth himſelf and his Forces as a Forlorn Hope, in what Deſign or Service ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall pleaſe his Majeſty to command him.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of all this Preparation, behold the Fatal hour approacheth; the King being himſelf very skilful in diſcharging of great Ordnance, draweth nigh to ſee the Cannoneer diſcharge a great Cannon called the <hi>Lion,</hi> newly ſent to him from beyond Sea; the Cannon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, flyeth in pieces, a Wedge whereof pierceth the King's body, and immediately he dyeth.</p>
            <p>Such of his Courtiers and Commanders as were by, though aſtoniſhed at this ſad Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, yet are ſo preſent in mind, as to cover his Body from the view of the Souldiers, leſt all ſhould turn to Confuſion.</p>
            <p>The Queen, who that very morning came into the Camp, with a chearful Countenance, wiſely conſealing the great grief of her heart, exhorteth the Nobility to go on with Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103185:42"/>notwithſtanding that ſad diſaſter: and for their further encouragement produceth her young Son the Prince, a Child of ſeven Years old, they ſalute him King; and being much animated by this couragious Deportment of the Queen, the Siege goeth on more furiouſly than before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> within,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1460"/> ſpent with much labout and continual watchings, Sound a Parley, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Articles of Surrender; march out honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, with freedom to Tranſport into <hi>England</hi> whatſoever belonged to the Garriſon: the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Surrendered, is forthwith Demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>Thus Dyed <hi>James</hi> the Second about the 11th. of <hi>September</hi> 1460, in the 22th. Year of his Reign, and the 29th. of his Age; he lived in a moſt deſperate time, and Rebellious Age; but diſpoſed with ſuch a well compoſed Mind, that Proſperity and Adverſity were equally enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by him (the Death of Earl <hi>Dowglas</hi> the only inſtance of his Impotency,) a Man of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Courage, and no leſs Clemency; muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent to his Friend, and merciful to his Foe: In a ſad time he fell, leaving Sorrow enough behind him, and a ſad People for ſo great a loſs.</p>

            <p>About this time a ſtrange Monſter was born in <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Male Child,

            <p>And about the ſame time too, a Monſtrous Cheat came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and much cheriſhed by the King too, <hi>Peter Werbeck,</hi> who pretending himſelf to be Son to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth of <hi>England,</hi> happily eſcaped from the cruel Claws of his Uncle <hi>Richard,</hi> had admittance to King <hi>James</hi> his preſence, who behaved himſelf with a behaviour ſo beſeeming his condition, and in a moſt elocuent Oration did ſo pathetically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver himſelf, touching the diſtreſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and his own marvellous preſervation, that the King and moſt of his Council, though not without the reluctancy of ſome of the wiſer, took compaſſion of him, and reſenting his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as the common intereſt of all Princes, with incredible, in conſideration, promiſe him aſſiſtance towards the regaining of his juſt Rights; provoked, the rather, as was pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſatisfie ſuch as oppoſed <hi>Peter</hi>'s deſign, by the breach of Truce made by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships whilſt <hi>Scotland</hi> was gaſping under the confuſion of a Civil War, indeed the late horrid Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion

               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:103185:90"/>their Soveraign Lady; but rather as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Friends and Neighbours to convince them of the unparalle'ld Wrongs and Injuries done to the Perſon and Honour of their Queen, (through whoſe ſides they had wounded all the Kings and Supream Magiſtrates in the World) and to Crave the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Queen, her nigheſt Kinſwoman in the World, either to perſuade her Rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to receive her again as their Sovereign, and reſtore her to all the Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of her Crown; or that failing, to grant her ſo conſiderable Forces as might be able to reduce them to Order and Obedience, which would be a Conceſſion no leſs Honourable to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> than Profitable to the Queen of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

            <p>As a Counterpoize to this Proteſtation, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners do alſo Proteſt, That they allowed not of that Proteſtation to the Prejudice of the Superiority that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had always Claimed over the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which now belonged to the Queen their Miſtreſs in the Right of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Then they proceeded to the Buſineſs; the Commiſſioners for the Exiled Queen firſt laid open all the Grievances and Wrongs that were thrown upon her, and under which ſhe now laboured in a Languiſhing Exile. The Commiſſioners for the Young King (in whoſe Name the Commiſſion ran) recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and highly Charge the Queen (no

            <p>But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners not ſatisfied with theſe things; they urge That the true Cauſes of ſuch rigorous Proceedings with their Queen might be produced; the knowledge whereof was the end of their preſent Meeting.

            <p>The former Two were peremptorily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and the Laſt had never been yielded to, but that they were well aſſured that the Queen would never Accept of it.</p>

            <p>The Vice-Roy thus ſurpriſed with Death, put all things into a new Confuſion, the Queens Party begin to ſtir, but to little purpoſe, they being Awed and Checked, and the Adverſe Party Encouraged and Strengthened by the Aſſiſtance of the Earl of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Drury,</hi> Commanders in Chief for Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> upon the Borders of <hi>England.</hi> So that the Queens Friends dare not put her Affairs to the Iſſue of a Battel; in the mean time the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſadors preſs Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to be more Kind and Favourable to her Couſin the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whom now ſhe had made a Cloſe Priſoner.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1572"/> and charging <hi>Leiceſter</hi> with unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the matter, relapſing into the ſame miſdemeanors, was remanded to the <hi>Tower:</hi> Arraigned before his Peers, proved guilty of Treaſon, and Executed; who upon his death bewailed his breach of promiſe to the Queen, that had before graciouſly Pardoned him, and contrary to his word, had again without the privity or leave of his Soveraign dealt with Queen <hi>Mary</hi> about Marriage, and ſuch weighty fairs, but diſowned all kindneſs for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and declared himſelf to die a Son of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The death of the Duke (when the diſtreſſed Queen in all her Letters to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> had endeavoured to excuſe) was no ſmall aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her ſorrow, and for his ſake or his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to her ſhe fears the worſe, and is now more cloſely impriſoned than before: and by her confinement her Health is daily more impaired, of which ſhe ſends many ſad accounts to the Queen;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1580"/> but to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But to conſummate her miſery, after all this one <hi>Ballard</hi> an Engliſh Prieſt with divers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Conſpire the death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the enlargement of Queen <hi>Mary, Babington</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:103185:94"/>a Gentleman of exceeding good Parts, writes to Queen <hi>Mary</hi> a full account of the deſign they had, the Letter came ſafe to the hands of her two Secretaries <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Curle;</hi> who knowing the averſeneſs of their Lady the Queen to ſuch wicked and deteſtable deſigns dare do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than conceal the Letter from her, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves return an Anſwer to it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585"/> wherein they give all the life and encouragement to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject imaginable and to this they counterfeit the Queens Majeſties Name. <hi>Babington</hi> preſuming it was the Queens Hand, ſheweth the Letter to divers whom he ſuppoſed he might truſt, and at laſt he commits that and all other their Papers to the truſt of one <hi>Gifford,</hi> who immediately carried them all to <hi>Walſingham,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Secretary, who upon the peruſal of them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the whole Plot; the Letter ſuppoſed to be Queen <hi>Maries</hi> own, he Communicates it to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Council, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately iſſue out Warrants for the apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Conſpirators, amongſt the firſt of theſe was <hi>Babington</hi> taken, and being examined touching his intercourſe with Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he had treated on that unhappy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with her, which falſehood he ſuppoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be truth, being impoſed upon by the Forgery of her Secretaries. After Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conviction, they are all Condemned, and Executed as Traytors.</p>
            <p>Upon this diſcovery Queen <hi>Mary</hi> is ſtill more cloſely impriſoned in <hi>Fotheringham</hi> Caſtle, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103185:95"/>the Guards ſet upon her are doubled, her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries taken from her and impriſoned, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> herſelf by Letter gave her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that ſhe had given Commiſſion to her Council of State to hear her in Judgment upon the Fact, with which ſhe was accuſed; the ſame day <hi>Thomas Bromeley,</hi> Knight, Lord Chancellor, and <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> came to her and declared what Power they had given them in their Commiſſion, and deſired her that ſhe would calmly hear her Accuſation, and what were the Facts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe was Charged, otherwiſe they both could and would proceed againſt her for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: to which ſhe made Anſwer, That ſhe was no Subject, and that ſhe would chooſe rather to Dye a thouſand times than by ſuch an Acknowledgment bring a Prejudice upon her Royal Majeſty. The Commiſſioners do ſtill inſiſt upon the Tenor of their Commiſſion; She demanded by what Law Civil or Canon, they would proceed againſt her? they ſaid, By the Law of <hi>England.</hi> Which you have made (ſaid ſhe) on purpoſe to Trap and Enſnare me, to which I am not ſubject, nor bound to ſubmit. <hi>Hatton</hi> the Queens Vice-Chamberlain preſſed her ſtill to Plead for her ſelf, and to remove the ſuppoſed Guilt, aſſuring her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be matter of greater Joy to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> than that ſhe ſhould Clear her Self of that Horrid Conſpiracy, whereof ſhe ſtood Accuſed. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> propoſes an Appeal to a Parliament, promiſing to Anſwer there to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103185:95"/>the whole Charge, knowing (as ſhe ſaid) that their Commiſſion was only deſigned as a Net to Catch her in, and Entrap her Innocence. Then ſaid the Treaſurer we will proceed to the Contempt, if you do (replyed the Queen) Examine your own Conſciences, and provide for your Honours, ſo God render to you and your Children, as you ſhall proceed againſt me in this Judgement.</p>
            <p>The next Morning ſhe ſent for one of the Commiſſioners to know if her Proteſtation againſt their Power or Authority to Try her (ſhe being no Subject but a Free and Abſolute Prince) were Recorded, if it were ſhe could then Juſtifie her ſelf without any Prejudice to Royal Dignity, or the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in particular; hereupon the Commiſſioners all do Aſſemble (but <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and <hi>Warwick,</hi> who were Sick) in the Chamber of Preſence, where was the Seat-Royal under a Cloth of State to repreſent the Majeſty of Queen <hi>E. za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and upon the one ſide of it a Chair of Crimſon Velvet for Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> after a Speech made by <hi>Bromley</hi> the Lord Chancellor, her Charge is Read, wherein ſhe is Accuſed of Conſpiring the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Deſtruction of the Realm, and the Subverſion of the Eſtabliſh'd Religion. This done the Queens Lawyers do moſt furiouſly Charge her with all imaginable Aggravations of the Crime: but of all that they produced againſt her to Convince her of the Crimes charged
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103185:96"/>upon her, nothing ſtuck upon her or pinched her ſave the Letter to <hi>Babington,</hi> whereunto her hand was ſet; <hi>Babington</hi> upon his Examination acknowledged his Correſpondence with her, and that he had received that Letter from her. <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Curle</hi> her Secretaries did Depoſe, That ſhe dictated it unto them, and with her own Hand had Subſcribed it. To what <hi>Babington</hi> had Depoſed ſhe Proteſted in the Preſence of the great God, that ſhe never received any Letter from, nor writ any Letter to the ſaid <hi>Babington,</hi> neither ever was ſhe made privy to, or knew of any written to or from him.</p>
            <p>As to the Depoſition of the Secretaries, if any ſuch Depoſition be made by them, it is ſaid ſhe, in the Preſence of God, a moſt Traiterous and Wicked Calumny in them, who being my Secreraries are therefore of all men the moſt perfidious in the World: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire my Secretaries who are now Witneſſes againſt me, may be brought into my Preſence where I am Confident, that they dare not Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to any ſuch Depoſition pretended to be made by them. Her Secretaries (who in the Judgment of moſt unbiaſs'd men were corrupted with Money) were never produced nor brought into her Preſence,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Emanuenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um qui pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Corrupti videbantur, teſtimonio, oppreſſa eſt.</hi> Camb. <hi>p.</hi> 493.</note> yet under the weight of their Teſtimonies was this Illuſtrious Princeſs cruſh'd a pieces: upon their Teſtimonies did the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners proceed to give Sentence againſt her, and accordingly after long Debates and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, Sentence was pronounced; which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103185:96"/>was immediately carried to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and preſented to the Parliament then ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for publication of it, where the Sentence of Death was Confirmed, and <hi>Beal</hi> after ſome demurr upon it, was ſent by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to Acquaint the Condemned Queen with the Mournful Sentence of her Death, and to tell her, That the Eſtates of the Realm met in Parliament had Approved and Confirmed it, and demanded ſpeedy Execution of the Sentence for Juſtice, Security and Neceſſity; which ſad News ſhe received with more than a Maſculine Courage or Greatneſs of Mind, Praiſing God for all his Diſpenſations towards her, and Acknowledging his Favours, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a Prieſt to Adminiſter the Sacrament unto her, and in all things to Aſſiſt her for a due Preparation, and Chriſtian Diſpoſe to Dye.</p>
            <p>The Cloth of State in her Chamber is beaten down by her Guard, and all Marks of Royalty are taken from her: but the Execution of the Sentence is for a time delayed by Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi> In the mean time the Condemned Queen writes to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Requeſting Three Things of her, Firſt, That ſhe being Dead, her Body might be Tranſported into <hi>France</hi> to be Buried there nigh the Aſhes of her dear Mother. Secondly, That ſhe might not ſuffer clancularly, but in the preſence of her Servants. And Laſtly, That they might all peaceably Enjoy thoſe ſmall Legacies, which her Poor and Exiled Condition was capable of Bequeathing them.</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:103185:97"/>
            <p>Neither was King <hi>James</hi> all this time remiſs in his Endeavours to procure his Mothers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, both by Perſuaſions and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications if any way it might be Effected, to whom the <hi>French</hi> King joyned Endeavours, urging it with Reaſons of greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That it was a Buſineſs ſo deteſtable, that it was without Example to put an Anointed Sovereign into the hands of the Common Hangman; that it was an Example of Dangerous Conſequence, thus to Proſtitute Sovereignty to the Wills of Rebels: That the Condemned Queen was not only her neareſt Kinſwoman, but her Gueſt, invited by her with Promiſe of Protection, and in Aſſurance of it had taken Shelter under her Scepter: neither would it have been denyed her by any Chriſtian Prince. That the Crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted was done by her Secretaries and not by her, and therefore Injuſtice not to be Charged upon her, but them. That if this Sentence were Executed, all Chriſtian Kings would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all their Honours and Rights wounded in that blow: and would accordingly reſent it and Avenge it. That her only Son King <hi>James,</hi> could never in Honour or Duty ſet down quiet under ſuch an Affront. And in fine, That Heaven it ſelf muſt needs Arm againſt ſo Bloody a Deſign: and therefore they adjure her by all the Love ſhe bears unto her ſelf, by all the Reſpects ſhe bears to her own People the Nation of <hi>England,</hi> that ſhe forbear the Execution. And if ſhe feared any Evil by
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103185:97"/>her Life, to preſerve her under the Power of ſtrong Guards, of which ſhe could not want plenty in <hi>England,</hi> if ſhe would not accept of their Security for her Peaceable behaviour.</p>
            <p>But as an over-preſſing Argument to all theſe the Enemies of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> that were continually preſent with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> beat it into her Ears, that the Lives of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were things incompatible, and for the Safety of one, it was neceſſary to take away the other, which otherwiſe would be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Sting to her, <hi>Sed mortua non mordet,</hi> the Grave was the ſecureſt Priſon ſhe could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at laſt Signs the Warrant for Execution, which being paſt the Broad-Seal, She next day ſends <hi>Killigrew</hi> to <hi>Daviſon</hi> to forbid the Command of Execution, telling him ſhe would go another way to work, but the Lords of the Council being Acquainted with it, they without the Conſent of the Queen wreſted it from <hi>Daviſon,</hi> and ſent <hi>Beale</hi> their Clark with the Mandate, and Letters to the Earls of <hi>Shrewsbury, Kent, Derby,</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> to ſee the ſame performed, which was the only thing that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had to offer in her own Excuſe to King <hi>James,</hi> Proteſting that it was done without her Knowledge, and quite contrary to her Intent, having, as ſhe ſaid, told <hi>Daviſon</hi> her Secretary, her Reſolution of taking New Meaſures, and that the Warrant was to have remained in his hand without Execution, unleſs a Foreign Invaſion or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick

            </p>
            <p>No ſooner came the Order to the hands of the Noblemen, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Feb. 7. 1586"/> than they repaired to <hi>Fother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> Caſtle, the Priſon where the Queen lay, and raiſing, her out of her Bed in the Morning, they read their Commiſſion to her, Advertiſing her That next day Morning ſhe was to Dye, which Order ſhe receiv'd without any diſcompoſure of Mind or change of Countenance, ſaying, She did not think that her Siſter Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would have brought her to that Extremity: but ſeeing it was her pleaſure ſhe was willing to ſubmit, Appealing to Heaven and Earth, to witneſs her Innocence, adding that it was her Comfort that ſhe dyed for and in the Religion of her Fore-fathers, beſeeching God to increaſe her Conſtancy and Courage to the Meaſure of her Afflictions. After theſe words ſhe beſought the Commiſſioners that ſhe might be permitted to Confer with her Confeſſor, which was denied her, tendring unto her in his ſtead the Biſhop or Dean of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> whom ſhe refuſed,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103185:98"/>ſaying, God ſhall be my Comforter. One of the Commiſſioners, the Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> told her, your life will be the death, and your death the life of our Religion: I thank you, ſaid ſhe, that I am thought worthy to dye for my Religion. After that the Commiſſioners were rerired, ſhe commanded her ſervants that Supper ſhould be diſpatched, and according to her uſual cuſtom ſhe Supped ſoberly, and diſcourſed to ſuch as were about her with a marvellous calmneſs and tranquillity of mind; at the end of Supper ſhe drank to all her ſervants with a grave and modeſt chearfulneſs, at which they all fell upon their knees, mingling floods of Tears with their Wine, ſo ſoon as they were able to ſpeak, having a little digeſted their ſorrow, they craved her pardon for their remiſsneſs in thoſe duties and ſervices her Majeſty had deſerved at their hands, and ſhe deſired them likewiſe to forget all her defects and failings towards them, comforting them, with an invincible courage; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to wipe away their Tears, and to rejoyce with her for that ſhe was now to be delivered from an abyſs of miſery.</p>
            <p>After Supper ſhe wrote three Letters, one to the King of <hi>France,</hi> another to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and a third to her Confeſſor: this done ſhe took a review of her Laſt Will, which ſhe had before committed to writing, and cauſed an Inventory of her Goods to be Read; and wrote down the names of thoſe to whom ſhe had beſtowed her Wardrobe; ſhe alſo diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mony to ſome with her own hand, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103185:99"/>ſhe retired herſelf, and being refreſhed with a little ſleep, ſhe ſpent the reſt of the night in Watching and Prayer.</p>
            <p>The next morning being the eighth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Feb. 8. 1587."/> ſhe dreſt and adorned herſelf with ſuch of Apparel and Ornaments as ſhe uſually wore on Feſtival days, and having again aſſembled her ſervants, ſhe cauſed her Will again to be Read to them, deſiring them to take in good part thoſe poor Legacies ſhe had bequeathed to them, the condition of her Eſtate not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her to give them any greater: She took her laſt farewel of them to fear God, to love one another, and to be ſtedfaſt in the Faith, and to Pray for her Soul: ſhe kiſſed the women, and permitted the men to kiſs her hand: and then returned to her Oratory, where ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to Prayer, until <hi>Thomas Andrews</hi> the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the County ſignified unto her that her hour was come, and it was time to come forth, which ſhe ſoon obeyed, and in a poſture full of Majeſty, and a Countenance very joyful, the Commiſſioners received her in a Gallery, where they did attend her, there likewiſe <hi>Melvin</hi> her Steward did preſent himſelf before her, and weeping fell on his knees to receive her laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: <hi>Melvin,</hi> ſaid ſhe, weep not, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, for this day you ſhall ſee <hi>Mary Stuart</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from all her ſorrows, and I adjure you to tell my Son, that I have always lived, and now I dye a Catholick, and that I exhort him to preſerve the Faith of his Anceſtors, to love
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103185:99"/>Juſtice, and to maintain his people in Peace, and to Enterprize nothing againſt the Queen of <hi>England.</hi> I have committed nothing againſt the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and I always loved <hi>France,</hi> God forgive them who have thirſted after my blood: then turning to the Lords ſhe requeſted that her ſervants after her death might be civily uſed, ſuffered to attend her perſon in the time of her death, and then to enjoy peaceably thoſe poor Legacies ſhe had bequeathed them: the Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> oppoſed her ſervants Attendance, yet the paſſionate deſires of the poor Queen, prevailed with the reſt of the Lords to permit ſix of them to wait on her to the Scaffold, with this train came ſhe into the Hall hung with black, and aſcended the Scaffold covered with black alſo: and ſat her down in a Chair prepared for her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beal</hi> read the Warrant for Execution, which ſhe heard very Patiently, the Dean of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> endeavoured to perſuade her, at laſt to relinquiſh the <hi>Roman,</hi> and embrace the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> for the Eternal good of her Soul: She beſought him to forbear, being Reſolved to Dye in the Faith of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>Then turning to the People ſhe Proteſted before God that ſhe had not Attempted any thing againſt the Life of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> nor any other thing deſerving Death: after ſome ſew words more touching Religion, her Eyes guſhed full of Tears, which were ſympatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally

            <p>The Executioner deſired her Pardon; I Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee (ſaid ſhe) and all my Perſecutors, after ſhe had kneeled down, and Prayed with extream fervency, concluding her Devotions in theſe words: <hi>As thy Arms Lord Jeſus were ſtretched out upon the Groſs, ſo receive me O Jeſus into the ſtretched forth Arms of thy Mercy.</hi> And after this ſhe diſpoſed her ſelf for the Block, her Maids having undreſſed her, ſhe laid open the moſt Beautiful Neck that ever received ſo mercileſs a Blow; then ſhe ſigned her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants with the Sign of the Croſs, and having kiſſed them all, ſhe ſmilingly bids them farewell, at which they poor Souls weep moſt bitterly, with Sighs and Tears inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for which ſhe meekly reproved them, ſaying, Nay what do you mean, do you ſuffer your ſelves to be Tranſported with Grief, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding you know I am going to Exchange a Temporal Kingdom full of Miſery, for an Everlaſting Empire filled with all Felicity. After this ſhe covered her Face, and laid her Neck on the Block, ſaying <hi>in te Domine ſperavi,</hi> and having repeated once and again, <hi>in manus tuas Domine.</hi> The Executioner gave a Blow, and with it made a dreadful wound in the hinder part of her head, and at two more the Inhuman Butcher ſevered her head from her Shoulders, ſaying, <hi>Long Live Queen</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,
